instructions

1. copy and paste all code from file 'index.js' into a browser console.

2. run the following code in the console to test the function

 - moneyOwed(data, 'Tommen')

 - howMuchDoIOwe(data, 'Same', 'Ola')

 - howMuchDoIOwe(data, 'Kelly', 'Tommen')

 I was unable to complete the fourth deliverable i'm afraid but I would love some feedback on my code as well as how I could have completed all deliverables.

 Thanks!
